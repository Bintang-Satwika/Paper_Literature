The paper outlines the requirements and scenarios for 5G RAN energy conservation, analyzes the underlying principles and core technologies. Additionally, it explores the integration of AI technology and proposes an evaluation system for assessing energy-saving measures in 5G RAN.

## I. REQUIREMENTS AND SCENARIOS OF 5G RAN ENERGY SAVING
The development of 5G technology has led to an increase in mobile data traffic, requiring the adoption of key technologies such as high frequency and large-scale antenna in 5G RAN. However, 5G RAN's energy consumption is 3 to 5 times that of 4G RAN.

## II. KEY FACTORS OF 5G RAN ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Over 60% of the energy consumption in 5G RAN is from main equipment, and the AAU (Active Antenna Unit) accounts for over 80%. Consequently, energy-saving technologies primarily target optimizing the energy efficiency of AAU.
